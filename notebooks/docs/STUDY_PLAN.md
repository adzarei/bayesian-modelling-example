Short answer: yes—this is a great fit for TensorFlow Probability (TFP). We’ll model a **shared linear trend** with **lab-specific offsets** and **known (possibly different) measurement σ’s**, then decide whether those offsets are needed by checking the posterior for their population scale and comparing models.

Before we dive into code, here’s the learning path + plan so the *why* is clear:

# What you need to understand (and where to read)

* **Bayesian Normal regression** (how we write $y\mid x$ with Normal noise, set priors for slope/intercept, and simulate the posterior/predictive):

  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 9 introduces the Normal regression likelihood and its assumptions.&#x20;
  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 10 shows posterior predictive checks and accuracy summaries you’ll use later.
* **Hierarchical (multilevel) models & partial pooling** (why lab offsets should be modeled as draws from a common distribution):

  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 15 (motivation for hierarchical data + partial pooling).
  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 16 (shrinkage: how group means/offsets are pulled toward the global mean).&#x20;
  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 17 (hierarchical **Normal** regression with varying intercepts—exactly our “per-lab offset” situation).
* **Computation & diagnostics** (we’ll use HMC/NUTS via TFP, then check ESS/R-hat and do PPCs):

  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 7 gives the MCMC intuition; you’ll see $\hat R$ and ESS there.&#x20;
* **Model comparison for the “offsets?” question**:

  * *Bayes Rules!* Ch. 10.3 and Ch. 11.5 use **LOO/ELPD** to compare models (we’ll compare “no-offset” vs “offsets”).

# The model we’ll build in TFP

Let experiments/labs be $i=1,\dots,N$ and measurements $j=1,\dots,n_i$.

* **Data model (heteroskedastic, σ known per measurement):**
  $y_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Normal}(m\,x_{ij}+b+o_i,\; \sigma_{ij})$.
* **Offsets (“random intercepts”):**
  $o_i \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0,\tau)$.
* **Priors (weakly informative; standardize $x$ first to make these sensible):**
  $m \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1)$, $b \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 2)$, $\tau \sim \mathrm{Half\text{-}Normal}(1)$.
  (These mirror the book’s “weakly informative Normal on coefficients; exponential/half-Normal on scales” choices. See the Normal regression priors and hierarchical regression examples. )

# How we’ll decide if offsets are needed

We’ll fit two models:

* **M₀ (no offsets):** $o_i \equiv 0$ (a single line with shared intercept).
* **M₁ (hierarchical offsets):** $o_i \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0,\tau)$.

Then we’ll:

1. Inspect the **posterior for $\tau$**—if it’s tightly near 0, there’s little evidence of lab offsets; if it’s clearly away from 0, that supports offsets. (Ch. 17 discusses interpreting the between-group sd vs within-group sd.)&#x20;
2. Compare **predictive performance** with **LOO/ELPD** (higher ELPD wins).
3. Use **posterior predictive checks** to see if M₁ better captures residual structure across labs.&#x20;

# Step-by-step guide (no code yet)

1. **Skim the readings** above in this order: Ch. 9 → Ch. 15 → Ch. 17 → Ch. 10.3/11.5 → Ch. 7. As you read, map the book’s “runner/artist” examples to our “lab offsets.”
2. **Preprocess**: center/scale $x$ (mean 0, sd 1), optionally center $y$; keep the provided $\sigma_{ij}$ as given.
3. **Write down both models** (M₀ vs M₁) formally, including priors. Check each assumption aligns with the data description (Normal noise with known, lab-dependent σ fits your statement).
4. **Plan the TFP build**:

   * Use `JointDistributionNamed` for $(m,b,\tau,o_{1:N})$ (omit $\tau, o$’s for M₀).
   * Implement the heteroskedastic Normal likelihood using the known $\sigma_{ij}$.
   * Sample with `tfp.mcmc.NoUTurnSampler` (NUTS), then run convergence checks (ESS, $\hat R$). (Diagnostics are discussed when the book introduces MCMC.)&#x20;
5. **Posterior predictive**: draw $y_{ij}^{\mathrm{rep}}$ for PPCs; make residual plots by lab.
6. **Model comparison**: compute pointwise log-likelihoods → LOO/ELPD; pick the model with better predictive fit and interpret $\tau$.
7. **Report**: slope $m$, intercept $b$, and (if supported) the offset distribution ($\tau$) and individual lab offsets $o_i$, with uncertainty; include PPCs and LOO summary.

Quick check: does the M₀ vs M₁ setup—and using the posterior for $\tau$ plus LOO/ELPD to decide about offsets—make sense as the decision rule?

# Developer checklist to produce the 3 deliverables

Below is a pragmatic, step-by-step guide to help you (i) **write the textual model description with priors & justification**, (ii) **evaluate the model**, and (iii) **summarize results**—all aligned to the assignment brief and the problem setup (linear relation with experiment-specific zero-point offsets and known per-experiment noise). The dataset description and the deliverables list come from *EnunciadoPEC.pdf* (7 labs, 163 rows, columns: lab id `i`, `x`, `y`, and per-lab σ; goal: infer `m`, `b`, and decide if offsets `o_i` exist).&#x20;

I’ll also point to the **primary sources** for each concept as requested:

* **BDA3 (Gelman et al., 3rd ed.)**: Hierarchies/exchangeability (Ch. 5), model checking & posterior predictive checks (Ch. 6), weakly-informative priors and regression thinking (Ch. 3 & 5), MCMC diagnostics (Ch. 11).
* **Bayesian Rules** (Kruschke-style exposition but lighter): intuitive refreshers on likelihood, priors, hierarchical shrinkage, PPCs, and model comparison (chapters on “Hierarchical models”, “Model checking”, “Model comparison”; use for accessibility).

> Tip: In your notebook, when you introduce **any** new concept (likelihood, exchangeability, PPC, etc.), add a one-sentence definition plus a bracketed reference, e.g., “Exchangeability means we treat the experiments as ‘similar enough’ to share a common prior structure \[BDA3 Ch. 5].”

---

## 1) Textual description of the hierarchical model (with priors & justification)

### A. Restate the data-generating process precisely

1. **Observed data structure.**
   You have experiments $i=1,\dots,N$ (here $N=7$) and within each experiment $n_i$ measurements $(x_{ij}, y_{ij})$. Measurement noise is Gaussian with mean 0 and **known** per-experiment standard deviation $\sigma_i$.&#x20;

   * Write: “We assume $y_{ij} \mid m,b,o_i \sim \mathcal{N}(m\,x_{ij} + b + o_i,\, \sigma_i^2)$, where $\sigma_i$ is known for lab $i$.”
   * Concept notes to include: **Likelihood** is the probability of the data given parameters \[BDA3 Ch. 1–3]; **known $\sigma_i$** means measurement variance is treated as fixed (not estimated), which simplifies computation and identifiability.

2. **Offset hypothesis.**
   The scientists suspect a per-experiment **zero-point offset** $o_i$ added to the global linear trend $m x + b$. Your model will test whether the data support non-zero $o_i$’s (versus a model with $o_i \equiv 0$).&#x20;

3. **Exchangeability.**
   Explain that labs are **exchangeable** a priori (no lab is special), which is the justification for a hierarchical prior that **pools** information across labs \[BDA3 Ch. 5]. This motivates $o_i$ to be drawn from a common distribution.

### B. Define the competing models you’ll fit (so evaluation later is meaningful)

1. **Baseline (no-offset) model $M_0$:**

   $$
   y_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(m\,x_{ij}+b,\ \sigma_i^2), \quad o_i \equiv 0.
   $$
2. **Hierarchical-offset model $M_1$:**

   $$
   y_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(m\,x_{ij}+b+o_i,\ \sigma_i^2), \qquad o_i \mid \tau \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\ \tau^2), \qquad \tau \ge 0.
   $$

   * The **hierarchy** on $o_i$ encodes exchangeability and induces **shrinkage**: noisy labs’ offsets are pulled toward 0 while strong signals resist shrinkage \[BDA3 Ch. 5; Bayesian Rules, “Hierarchical models”].

> **Why mean 0 for $o_i$?** Identifiability: if $o_i$ had a free mean, it would be non-identifiable with the global intercept $b$. Constraining $E[o_i]=0$ lets $b$ be the overall intercept \[BDA3 Ch. 5].

### C. Recommend data scaling and parameterization (practical, improves mixing)

* **Center $x$** (e.g., subtract its mean) and optionally **scale** $x$ (divide by its SD). This reduces posterior correlation between $m$ and $b$ and stabilizes priors \[BDA3 Ch. 3, advice on weakly-informative priors & predictor centering].
* Note in text that all priors below assume this centering; otherwise adjust scales accordingly.

### D. Specify **weakly-informative priors** (state and justify)

For clarity give both mathematical form and rationale:

* **Slope $m$:**

  $$
  m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \sigma_m^2)
  $$

  with $\sigma_m$ chosen to cover plausible slopes after $x$ scaling (e.g., $\sigma_m=2$ or 5). **Justification:** weakly-informative to regularize extreme slopes while being broad enough not to dominate the likelihood \[BDA3 Ch. 3].
* **Intercept $b$:**

  $$
  b \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \sigma_b^2)
  $$

  with $\sigma_b$ set using the rough scale of $y$ after centering. If you center $y$, $\sigma_b$ can be moderate (e.g., 5–10). **Justification:** weak information reflecting that $b$ is an overall level \[BDA3 Ch. 3].
* **Offsets $o_i$ (only in $M_1$):**

  $$
  o_i \mid \tau \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\, \tau^2).
  $$

  **Justification:** exchangeable labs and shrinkage \[BDA3 Ch. 5].
* **Hyper-scale $\tau$:**

  $$
  \tau \sim \mathrm{half\text{-}Student\text{-}t}(\nu=3,\, s)
  \quad\text{or}\quad 
  \tau \sim \mathrm{half\text{-}Normal}(s).
  $$

  Choose scale $s$ to be **weakly-informative** on the same units as $y$ (after centering), e.g., $s=5$. Heavy-tailed half-t makes the model tolerant of a few large offsets while still shrinking most $o_i$ \[BDA3 Ch. 5; Bayesian Rules “Priors that stabilize estimates”].
* **Known $\sigma_i$:** Use the values provided in the CSV directly in the likelihood (no prior needed).&#x20;

Add a short “Prior Predictive Reasonableness” sentence: simulate from the prior (without data) to check that $m\,x+b+o_i$ yields $y$ in realistic ranges \[BDA3 Ch. 6—prior predictive checks help avoid pathologies].

### E. State the **posterior** and what you will compute

* Posterior is proportional to likelihood × priors. You will obtain draws for $\{m,b\}$ under $M_0$ and $\{m,b,o_{1:N},\tau\}$ under $M_1$ using HMC/NUTS (e.g., PyMC/NumPyro/TFP). **Introduce MCMC briefly**: a method to simulate from the posterior when it’s not available in closed form \[BDA3 Ch. 11].
* Mention **identifiability** again: centering $x$ and $E[o_i]=0$ prevent confounding with $b$ \[BDA3 Ch. 5].

### F. (Optional but nice) Reparameterization detail

* If $\tau$ is small, a **non-centered** parameterization $o_i = \tau\,\tilde{o}_i, \tilde{o}_i\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ can mix better \[BDA3 Ch. 11].

---

## 2) Model evaluation (what to compute and what figures/tables to include)

Organize this section of your notebook with clear subsections. For each method, add one-line concept explanations with references.

### A. Convergence diagnostics (mandatory)

1. **Trace plots** for $m,b$ (both models), $\tau$ and a few $o_i$ (in $M_1$).
2. **R-hat** $\approx 1.00$ and **Effective Sample Size (ESS)** sufficiently large \[BDA3 Ch. 11].
3. **Divergences** (if using NUTS) = 0 (or explain/resolve via step size/reparam).

> Include a small table: R-hat and ESS for key parameters.

### B. Posterior summaries (mandatory)

* Report **mean/median** and **95% credible intervals** for $m$, $b$, and $\tau$ (plus each $o_i$ if offsets are included).
* Plot **forest/interval plots** (one for $\{m,b\}$; one for $\{o_i\}$).

### C. Posterior predictive checks (mandatory)

Explain **PPC**: simulate replicated data $y^{\mathrm{rep}}$ from the posterior predictive distribution and compare to observed data to assess fit \[BDA3 Ch. 6; Bayesian Rules “Posterior predictive checks”].

* **Global PPC:** overlay observed $y$ vs draws of $y^{\mathrm{rep}}$ (histograms or KDEs).
* **By-lab PPC:** for each lab $i$, compare the distribution (or mean/variance, residual patterns) of $y$ and $y^{\mathrm{rep}}$.
* **Test quantities:** e.g., residual means per lab, overall slope of $(x,y)$, fraction of points > threshold. Show posterior predictive p-values or just visual checks (BDA3 favors graphical PPCs).

### D. Model comparison: is there evidence for offsets?

Explain predictive criteria briefly: **out-of-sample predictive accuracy** is preferred over Bayes factors for continuous-parameter hierarchical models \[BDA3 Ch. 6–7; Bayesian Rules “Model comparison”].

* Compute **LOO** (leave-one-out cross-validated expected log predictive density) or **WAIC** for $M_0$ vs $M_1$.
* Report **$\Delta$LOO** (or $\Delta$WAIC) with SE; a positive $\Delta$ favoring $M_1$ indicates better predictive fit.
* Also inspect **$\tau$**’s posterior: if most mass is near 0, offsets may be unnecessary; if $\tau$ is clearly away from 0 and several $o_i$ exclude 0, that supports offsets.

> Include a table: `Model, elpd_loo, SE, p_loo, Δelpd, ΔSE`.

### E. Residual diagnostics (nice to have)

* Compute residuals $r_{ij} = y_{ij} - (m\,x_{ij}+b+o_i)$ (or without $o_i$ in $M_0$).
* Plot residuals vs $x$, and by lab to check for structure; with known $\sigma_i$, standardized residuals $r_{ij}/\sigma_i$ should look like $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ if the model is adequate \[BDA3 Ch. 6].

### F. Sensitivity analysis (recommended)

* Refit $M_1$ with slightly different weakly-informative scales (e.g., $\sigma_m,\sigma_b,s$ for $\tau$).
* Check stability of inferences (especially the decision about offsets). \[BDA3 Ch. 6]

---

## 3) Brief summary of results (how to write it)

Write this last; keep it **short, quantitative, decision-oriented**, and consistent with the evaluation above.

1. **State the estimated linear relationship.**
   “Posterior median slope $m=\ldots$ (95% CrI $\ldots$), intercept $b=\ldots$ (95% CrI $\ldots$).”
   If you centered $x$/$y$, remind the reader how to transform back to original units.

2. **Offsets decision.**
   Combine **predictive** (LOO/WAIC) and **parameter** evidence ($\tau$, $o_i$ intervals):

   * “Model $M_1$ improves expected predictive fit over $M_0$ by $\Delta$LOO = … (SE …).
     The offset scale $\tau = …$ (95% CrI …), and $k$ out of 7 lab offsets have 95% CrIs excluding 0.
     This provides **evidence for experiment-dependent zero-point offsets**.”
   * Or the opposite if $\Delta$LOO is small and $\tau$ near 0.

3. **Model adequacy.**
   One sentence citing PPC: “Posterior predictive checks show good replication of the marginal distributions and by-lab means; residuals are structureless with standardized spread consistent with the known $\sigma_i$’s.”

4. **Limitations.**
   Brief note (1–2 bullets): linearity assumption; potential unmodeled heterogeneity beyond zero-point offsets; reliance on provided $\sigma_i$ being correct.

## Concrete “to-do” list for the notebook

You can copy these as section headers and cells:

1. **Load & EDA**

   * Read `/mnt/data/properMotions.csv`. Confirm there are **163 rows** and **7 labs**, and that the `sigma` column is constant within each lab (group-by check). Summarize $n_i$ per lab.&#x20;
   * Center/scale $x$ (and optionally $y$) and record transforms for interpretation.

2. **Model definitions (text cell)**

   * Write $M_0$ and $M_1$ exactly as above, with 2–3 sentences explaining **likelihood**, **exchangeability**, and **hierarchical shrinkage** with **citations** \[BDA3 Ch. 5; Bayesian Rules “Hierarchical models”].
   * List priors with scales and justifications (weakly-informative; prior predictive sanity check) \[BDA3 Ch. 3, 5].

3. **Implementation (code cells)**

   * Choose a Python PPL (PyMC, NumPyro, or **TensorFlow Probability** as you prefer).
   * Implement $M_0$ and $M_1$; if $M_1$ struggles, switch to **non-centered** $o_i=\tau\tilde o_i$.
   * Run NUTS (multiple chains, warmup). Save posterior samples.

4. **Diagnostics (text + figures)**

   * Trace plots for $m,b$ (both models), and $\tau,o_i$ (for $M_1$).
   * R-hat/ESS tables; note any divergences and how you resolved them \[BDA3 Ch. 11].

5. **Posterior summaries (tables + forest plots)**

   * Report medians and 95% CrIs for $m,b$ (both models).
   * For $M_1$: forest plot of $o_i$; summary of $\tau$.

6. **Posterior predictive checks (figures)**

   * Global $y$ vs $y^{\mathrm{rep}}$ density overlays.
   * By-lab PPC panels, plus standardized residual checks \[BDA3 Ch. 6].

7. **Model comparison (table)**

   * Compute **LOO** (or WAIC) for $M_0$ and $M_1$.
   * Present $\Delta$LOO with SE and a short interpretation (predictive performance lens).

8. **Sensitivity analysis (optional)**

   * Refit $M_1$ with slightly different prior scales; note stability.

9. **Results summary (short text cell)**

   * 3–6 sentences covering: estimated slope/intercept, offsets evidence (based on $\Delta$LOO and $\tau$/$o_i$), brief PPC adequacy statement, and one limitation.

---

## Handy phrasing templates you can paste

* **Model statement:**
  “We model $y_{ij}$ with a shared linear relation and experiment-specific zero-point offsets:
  $y_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(m\,x_{ij}+b+o_i,\sigma_i^2)$. Exchangeability across experiments motivates $o_i\mid\tau\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2)$ \[BDA3 Ch. 5]. We place weakly-informative priors on $(m,b)$ and a half-t prior on $\tau$ to encourage shrinkage while allowing occasional large offsets \[BDA3 Ch. 3, 5].”

* **PPC sentence:**
  “Posterior predictive simulations replicate the overall and by-lab distributions of $y$, with standardized residuals approximately $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ given known $\sigma_i$ \[BDA3 Ch. 6].”

* **Decision about offsets:**
  “$M_1$ achieves higher expected out-of-sample predictive accuracy (ΔLOO …, SE …) and $\tau$ is clearly above 0; several $o_i$ exclude 0, indicating credible experiment-dependent offsets \[BDA3 Ch. 6–7].”

---

### What to **definitely include** to satisfy the grader

* A **clear mathematical model block** for $M_0$ and $M_1$ (with likelihood and priors) + **justifications** referencing BDA3/Bayesian Rules.
* **Diagnostics + PPC** figures and a **predictive comparison** (LOO/WAIC) explicitly tied to the **offset decision**.
* A **succinct results paragraph** that answers the question: *Is there evidence for experiment-dependent zero-point offsets?*
* A short note that the per-lab $\sigma_i$ are **treated as known**, exactly as specified in the exercise.&#x20;

If you follow the checklist above, you’ll have all three deliverables—model description (with priors & reasoning), model evaluation, and a tight results summary—fully covered and aligned with the assignment.
