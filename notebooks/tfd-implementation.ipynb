    "## Exercise Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ scientific experiments to determine the coefficients of a linear relationship between two variables: $x$ (predictor) and $y$ (response).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = m \\cdot x + b + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\epsilon$, which is the measurement error or noises is normally distributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each experiment $i$ ($i = 1, 2, ..., N$) we have a set of $n_i$ measures indexed by $j$ ($j = 1, 2, ..., n_i$). Each measurement can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(y_{ij}, x_{ij}) for j in {1, 2, ..., n_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the follwing assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) All $N$ experiments are interchangeable.\n",
    "2) $m$ and $b$ are the same for all experiments (same linear relationship).\n",
    "3) The uncertainty in the measurement of $x_{ij}$ is negligible.\n",
    "4) Each experiment $i$ has its own known noise standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ (i.e., the noise is always centered at zero, but its standard deviation is experiment-dependent and known).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "We suspect that each of the N experiments is affected by a Calibration problem of the zero points. This can be represented as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{ij} = m \\cdot x_{ij} + b + o_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $o_i$ is the zero-point offset specific to experiment $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "The objective is to implement a hieararchical Bayesian model that described the dataset and use thos model in order to infer the linear relationship parameters and prove whether there is evidence that supports that there is a zero point offset per experiment."
